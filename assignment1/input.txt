The strength of this cipher is that there are multiple ciphertext letters for 
each plaintext letter, one for each unique letter of the keyword. Thus, the letter frequency information is obscured. However, not all knowledge of the plaintext structure is lost. For example, Figure 3.6 shows the frequency distribution for a Vigenere 
cipher with a keyword of length 9. An improvement is achieved over the Playfair 
cipher, but considerable frequency information remains.
It is instructive to sketch a method of breaking this cipher, because the method 
reveals some of the mathematical principles that apply in cryptanalysis.
First, suppose that the opponent believes that the ciphertext was encrypted 
using either monoalphabetic substitution or a Vigen√®re cipher. A simple test can 
be made to make a determination. If a monoalphabetic substitution is used, then 
the statistical properties of the ciphertext should be the same as that of the language of the plaintext. Thus, referring to Figure 3.5, there should be one cipher letter with a relative frequency of occurrence of about 12.7%, one with about 9.06%, 
and so on. If only a single message is available for analysis, we would not expect 
an exact match of this small sample with the statistical profile of the plaintext language. Nevertheless, if the correspondence is close, we can assume a monoalphabetic substitution.
